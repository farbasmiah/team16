Before you can run any script you will need to do chmod +x <script name>


Once that has been done type the following into terminal (on deployed server)
crontab -e
Paste the below line and press Ctrl X, yes to save buffers then enter
*/15 * * * * /home/localuser/team16/backup.sh
Also create a folder called Recovery (mkdir Recovery)

Then on the create a folder called Backup on the backup server then do the same but instead write this:
20 00 * * * /home/localuser/Backup/Sortbackup.sh
